			<p>Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all wizards and muggles, a reference term that means non-magical people</p>
			<p>Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, critical acclaim, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers, and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[2] The series has also had its share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts. As of May 2013, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into seventy-three languages.[3][4] The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.</p>

			<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)"><img src="harrypotter.jpg" width ="100" height ="100" align="left"></a>
			<p><b><i>Harry James Potter</b></i> is the title character and protagonist of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Potter, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. Thus, he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors. Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort, the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, Lily and James.</p>
			<br>					
			<li><h3>Ron Weasely (Friend of Harry)</h3></li>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Weasley"><img src="Ron.jpg" width ="100" height ="100" align="left"></a>
			<p><b><i>Ronald Bilius "Ron" Weasley</b></i> is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family, who reside in "The Burrow" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of the Gryffindor house. Ron is present in most of the action throughout the series.</p>
			<br>		
			<li><h3>Hermonie Granger (Friend of Harry)</h3></li>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger"><img src="Hermione.jpg" width ="100" height ="100" align ="left"></a>
			<p><b><i>Hermione Jean Granger</b></i> is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. She first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as a new student on her way to Hogwarts. After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls toilets, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to help them. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself at a younger age, with her insecurity and fear of failure.[1] The character was voted the best female character in a poll conducted amongst Hollywood professionals, by The Hollywood Reporter in 2016</p>
			<br>	
			<li><h3>Voldemort (Dark Lord)</h3></li>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Voldemort"><img src="Voldemort.jpg" width ="120" height ="120" align ="left"></a>
			<p><b><i>Lord Voldemort</b></i> (born Tom Marvolo Riddle) is a fictional character and the main antagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of Harry Potter novels. Voldemort first appeared in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which was released in 1997. Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series, except the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, where he is only mentioned.</p>
			<p>According to Rowling, the 't' in "Voldemort" is silent,[1] as it is in the French word for death, "mort".[2] Jim Dale pronounced it so in the first four US audiobooks, yet the characters in the film version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone pronounced the "t"â€”after which Dale changed his audiobook pronunciation accordingly. For all the UK audiobooks Stephen Fry pronounced the name including the "t".</p>
				
			<li><h3>Sirius Black (GodFather of Harry)</h3></li>
			<a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_Black"><img src="Sirius.jpg" width ="120" height ="120" align ="left"></a>	
			<p><b><i>Sirius Black</b></i> is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, played by Gary Oldman. Black, also known as Padfoot or Snuffles (in his Animagus form) was a pure-blood wizard, the older son of Orion and Walburga Black, and the brother of Regulus Black. He is Harry Potter's godfather. He was the best friend of Harry's father, James Potter, along with Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. These four were known as the marauders in their school days, and were attributed with creating the Marauder's Map.</p>
			<p>He, along with his three friends, belonged to Gryffindor house when at Hogwarts, unlike the rest of his family, who had belonged to the house of Slytherin. He disliked his family very much, and ran away from home to James' house when he was sixteen. His prized possession in his youth was a flying motorbike.</p>
